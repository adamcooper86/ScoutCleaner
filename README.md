# ScoutCleaner
A ruby utility to remove special characters from legacy file names

## Directions:

To use this utility, you have to give it a full path name to a folder on the system. The full path name does not need a trailing backslash. For example: /Users/Adam/Documents

You can do this when you run the program by adding the path after the ruby command. For example: ruby scoutcleaner.rb /Users/Adam/Documents
